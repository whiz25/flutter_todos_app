## Classes
- TodoState: This class manages the state of the app locally. It takes a list of Todo items a required parameter.
- TodoBloc: This class supplies the TodoState class with data from the TodoRepository class. It has a method that creates a new 
todo item. This method takes a String as a parameter.
- ITodoRepository: This is an abstract class with well defined methods that are implemented in the 
TodoRepository class.
- TodoRepository: This class holds the only source of data in the app. It overrides five methods from the ITodoRepository class.
- Todo: This is the model class of the app. This class has fields annotated as HiveFields. These fields are used by the hive_generator and build_runner to auto generate the TodoAdapter.

## Methods
- addNewTodo: Adds a new todo item to the database. Takes a string as a parameter.
- deleteTodo: Deletes a todo item. Takes an id as a parameter.
- getAllTodos: Returns a list of todo items.
- updateTodoById: Updates a todo item based on the id of the todo item. The updated content is inserted at the specific index.

## State Management
- The state is managed locally using the Bloc pattern and globally using the async_redux package.
The async_redux package is built on top of the redux library.

## Data
- Data is stored locally on the user's device using Hive database. HiveDatabase has two boxes: A box
for todo items and another for todo lists. A todo list's ID is used as the foreign key 
in the todo's item box. A todo item's ID is the same as the ID for the todo list it's added 
to.

## Localization 
- A localization folder is added in the assets folder with json files for English and Danish languages. These are the two supported 
languages currently.

## Directories
- Animations: Contains animation logic for the app. 
- Async_redux: Contains logic for managing state globally.
- Blocs: Contains bloc logic for local state management.
- Keys: Contains widget keys. These keys will be used through the app and when testing widgets.
- Model: Contains models. The Todo model and the auto generated TodoAdapter.
- Repository: Contains repository logic 
- Screens: This folder houses all pages in the app 
- Widgets: Houses re-usable widgets like the progress indicator
- Utils: Contains helper code. The AppTheme resides in this folder 


## Features
  ### Add due date 
    - A user should be able to add a due date to a todo item
    #### Implementation
    - The dueDate is displayed in two different screens. The todo_list_screen and the todo_details_screen.
    - The bloc will be used to manage it's state.
    - Initially the due date for any todo will be `null`
    - The app state will take a dateTime field called `dueDate`
    - The update method will be called to set the due date of the todo item. 
    - The update due date will be rendered in the UI using the bloc and the state
